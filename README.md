# Semantics
_"Semantics is the study of language meaning, which is the words we use to communicate and for HTML is the mark up for documents._ ![](https://i.imgur.com/WFAP06Y.jpg)

### What is this?
It is a part of my [Pasture Plan project](https://github.com/grgdhiraj/PasturePlan), where as of plan I want to create a website with semantic HTML. 

### What is this about?
Use HTML5 semantics tags have many benefits apart from efficiency and site performance in search engines. It help us not only to build better site structures, but more importantly, improve website's accessibility.

### Goal
* Using the HTML5 semantic tag.
* Make the meanings of HTML elements better understandable for diverse audiences, _particularly those who live with disabilities_.
